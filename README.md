Here is my first Python Project that includes a database made possible with SQLite to keep track of my PC business' Inventory.
I chose to go with SQLite because of its ease of use and integration within python.
I used Streamlit for my front-end integration and deployment.
It also will be stored locally on my computer which allows me to have a database without setting up and outsourcing a separate server. 
The main motive to use the database as an Inventory List was to help me keep my PC selling business in check and keep track of my current inventory and its value.
Overall, this project was a great gateway into using git for version control and implementing a database into a project.
